## Overview
Main project: Finding best recommendation system by comparing Content based system and Collaborative Filtering systems for movie dataset
Hypothese: ML is best approach for recommendation system
Tesing: Building different recommendation systems using different techniques and recommended systems by catalog coverage  

Sub project: Clustering people based on average genre rating the gave
Process:
1.Data Acquisition
2.Data cleaning
3.Data exploration and analysis
4.Statistical Modelling
5. Sub project:
    Feature selection
    Train Unsupervised Learning model
    Model evaluation using Elbow method and Silhouette score
6. Building recommendation Engines:
- Content Based Filtering
-Item-Item based Filtering
-User-Item based Filtering
-Model based Filtering
-Model based Filtering using ML approach:
    Train/Test Split
    Train Model
    Tuning Model
    Evaluate Model
-Compare Recommendation systems based on catalog coverage
