## Overview
Main project: Building recommendation systems based on different techniques.
Hypothese/Question to answer: Is machine Learning the best apporach to build a recommendation system on?
Tesing: Building different recommendation systems using different techniques and compare them to machine learning approach

Sub project: Clustering people based on average genre rating the gave
Hypothesis: What genre determines most that people differentiate?
Tesing: Building an unsupervies machine leanring alg to identify most important feature for clustering people based on movie genres.

Process:
1.Data Acquisition
2.Data cleaning
3.Data exploration and analysis
4.Statistical Modelling
5. Sub project:
    Feature selection
    Train Unsupervised Learning model
    Model evaluation using Elbow method and Silhouette score
6. Building recommendation Engines:
- Content Based Filtering
-Item-Item based Filtering
-User-Item based Filtering
-Model based Filtering
-Model based Filtering using ML approach:
    Train/Test Split
    Train Model
    Tuning Model
    Evaluate Model using Catalog Coverage
